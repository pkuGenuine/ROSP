# ROSP
ROSP(Rust Open Source Projects) is a binary function dataset. We collect
popular Rust open source projects from [github ranking](https://github.com/EvanLi/Github-Ranking/blob/master/Top100/Rust.md)
and try to compile them with different optimization level on x64 platform.

## Full Dataset
File [rosp_data.tar.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15SgUOeLTpX2xJpPkXADxZvBG7O8EfbOe/view?usp=sharing)
contains all valid binary functions we managed to
collect from binaries.
